# Advent Of Code :evergreen_tree: ![Last Commit on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/last%20commit-2021--12--07-brightgreen)

[Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions, primarily with the aim of building some Scala muscle. The 
focus is on writing __clean__, and as close to __pure functional__ code, with zero side-effects. I will chose to use 
mutable state where its pragmatic and a pure functional solution requires too much gymnastics and/or has a chance of 
making the code too non-performant. A lot of solutions therefore deliberately introduce explicit types, and instead 
of aiming to be super-concise, break the problem down into cleaner functions that build to a solution, and sometimes 
use mutable arrays etc.
